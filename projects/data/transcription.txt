# Tips

So, as I mentioned before, it covers until copyrights. Remember? Copyrights chapter. Patent and stuff like that. 


## Lessig's Law 4 Modalities

So, I hope that you also give focus attention to social media platform, 
for example. And how you analyze the social media platform usage and its impacts. 
Remember the Lessig's four modalities? What are the modalities? Remember? The Lessig's law. 
So, you have 4 modality analysis. So, you have law, you have social norms, market and architecture. 
So, you need to look into such, what we call it, describe. Of course, there are many things. 
But, specifically, when we look at social media usage and its impacts, how you analyze from those 4 parameters. 

## Advancement in IT in term of globalization (In Malaysia Context)

So, you should be able to do that. And then, we also have covered an important part related about advancement in IT. 
So, actually, we want to see how the advancement in IT actually affect in terms of globalization. Particularly in the Malaysian context. 
How the new technologies advancement actually make it easy for us to go global in Malaysian context. 
Maybe in terms of education, business, easily to work with people around the world. How you use technologies, how the technologies help to fulfill such the needs for you to do global business and education.

## Horizontal and Vertical Integration

I think we also cover about, remember, we talk about integration. There are how many types of integration? There are horizontal, vertical. 
So, you should know what those mean. What vertical means, horizontal means. Maybe in the Malaysian context, can you see the companies that have moved towards that integration? 
Maybe you see in the banking, telecommunication, they have integrated. But you need to know what type of integration. 
And through this integration, what is the benefit or how it can benefit the companies who do such merging and integration. 
So, you should be able to explain or know about that. 

## IP, Patent, Copyright

I think in the last chapter of the week, we talk about the IP. 
There are many types of IP, right? Copyright, patent. 
So, you should be able to know, of course in the university context, what are the things that can be, what sort of IP that we can produce. What are the examples of IP? 
For example, in terms of the, maybe I give you an example, you need to look back at the lecture notes. 
So, for example, maybe in terms of the IP, for you and your lecturer, perhaps you come up with new application or software, right? 
So, that if let's say, software or application. So, that if you want to do patent, it's quite challenging. 
Because patent is, you need to see the novelty or the framework or the model behind it. But maybe for the sake of application software, that is something useful, perhaps that can be made under copyright, right? 
Maybe there's a logo that you've made for that software. So, there are many other avenues and context in university that you can think of IP. 
So, you need to think what they are. So, I guess that, of course, there are things that you need to also read. But these are the important things that you also need to stress on.
